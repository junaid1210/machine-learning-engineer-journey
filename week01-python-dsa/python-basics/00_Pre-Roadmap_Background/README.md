Pre-Roadmap Background (Before Week 1)

Before officially starting this 12-week Machine Learning Engineering roadmap, I completed foundational learning through:

📘 EduQual Level 6 Diploma in AI & AIOps (AlNafi)
Covered essential topics including:

Classical Machine Learning models (Regression, Classification)

Deep Learning (Basic neural networks, CNNs)

Computer Vision (OpenCV basics, image processing)

Natural Language Processing (Text preprocessing, basic NLP pipelines)

Data Cleaning and EDA (Pandas, NumPy, handling missing values)

🎥 Self-Study via YouTube & Online Resources
Learned practical skills through small projects and tutorials:

Trained ML models using scikit-learn

Created simple neural networks with PyTorch

Handled datasets for tabular and image data

Documented learnings through personal notes

📝 Although I did not actively maintain a GitHub profile during that time, I preserved my notes, code snippets, and understanding.
➡️ This roadmap marks a fresh, structured journey where I will build a public portfolio, track progress, and document projects + learning outcomes on GitHub from start to finish.
